# playwright-proof-of-concept
Proof of concept for an integrated system with both UI and API checks

This is an anonymised version of a segment of a system I designed in the past

*Please note that this will not run successfully as it is anonymised - it simply serves as a proof of concept as to the work I produce.*

## How to run - if it was functional

You would use standard "npx playwright test <x>", with <x> denoting a specific file pattern, left blank for all, or the uifilter tests can be retrieved via '--grep "@uifilter"' suffix
